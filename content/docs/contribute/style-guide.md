## Layouts

In addition to Hugo's default list & single layouts, the docs section also supports codelab-list & codelab-single. Their inner workings are explained in the frontmatter section.

## Frontmatter

## Content

1. No HTML in markdown content files.  
  HTML shall be written in `/layouts/` for the purposes of maintaining consistency across all other pages.
2. Keep things consistent across sections.  
  Content pages within a section should be written such that they match the format of other content within the section.
  There may be some exceptions, but keep this in mind when contributing.
3. Examples should be clear and concise.  
  Make sure to use examples that are accurate to the topic, and are easy to understand.
4. File names should be concise and prioritize '-' over '_'
  We've opted to use '-' instead of '_' in link names to keep things consistent.  
  The only exception to this is when '_' is part of a name, like in 'at_server', this also allows us to distinguish between names and spaces in the url.  
  Links should be as pretty as possible for sharing purposes.

## Building Layouts

1. Use [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) for styling where available.  
  All styling should be done in bootstrap, unless it is unable to achieve what you are after.
2. Ensure compatibility when writing custom styles and layouts.
  This includes compatibility for dark/light modes, various screen sizes, and has good browser support.

## JavaScript

This site is using {{< a target="_blank" href="https://purgecss.com/" >}}purgeCSS{{</ a >}} for the staging and production builds.
If you write JavaScript that modifies the DOM in any way, ensure that all style selectors are added to the safelist in `config/postcss.config.js`.

## Assets

1. External assets and images should be stored in the static folder.  
  Site-only images should be stored at page level where possible, or in the assets folder if it is used in multiple places across the site.
  See [here](/docs/contribute/shortcodes/image/) for more information.
2. Use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/) for icons.

## Reference
If you want to add your own definition/topic to the reference section, please adhere to the following guidelines.
1. Follow all rules in [Content](/docs/contribute/style-guide/#content)
2. Copy the `docs-reference-single.md` archetype and use it in `/docs/reference/` when you make your own page.
3. Ensure `toc` property to `true`. (See [Frontmatter](/docs/contribute/style-guide/#frontmatter))
4. Use `##` markdown headings for main titles on the page and `###` and `####` for any sub headings.
5. For links, use markdown (e.g. `[here](https://atsign.com)`) or the [anchor tag (a) shortcode](/docs/contribute/shortcodes/links/).
6. For `canonical` links, be sure to use the [anchor tag (a) shortcode](/docs/contribute/shortcodes/links/) for better SEO.
