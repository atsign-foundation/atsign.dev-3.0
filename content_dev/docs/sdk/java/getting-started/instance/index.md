To create an instance of AtClient, use one of the factory methods. Note: you must have the `.atKeys` file in a `keys/` directory. You can generate a .atKeys file from using the Register CLI or Onboaring CLI if you already own the atSign.
```
String ATSIGN_STR = "@bob";
AtSign atSign = new AtSign(ATSIGN_STR);
AtClient atClient = null;
try {
    atClient = AtClient.withRemoteSecondary(atSign);
} catch (AtException e) {
    System.err.println(e);
    e.printStackTrace();
}
// use atClient
```

There are a number of other factory methods for creating an AtClient instance to suit your needs. See the image below.
