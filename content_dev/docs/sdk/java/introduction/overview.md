### What is at_java?
at_java is Atsign’s implementation of the atProtocol. Just like Atsign’s dart libraries, at_java allows you to interact with Atsign’s services like registering atSigns, onboarding, communicating with the root & secondary servers, and more.

### Where can at_java be used?
As long as the device running at_java has
1. Internet
2. Java 8 or higher

Then at_java can be used to add simplicity and security to your Java applications and/or IoT devices running Java.

at_java is perfect for those who want to interact with low-level atProtocol for whatever the use case is. Whether it be IoT devices sending end-to-end-encrypted data, sharing medical data between patients, or storing data in your Java apps that you can feel safe about owning; the possibilities are endless with the power of the atProtocol.

As of writing this (July 20, 2022), at_java only has remote secondary implementation meaning that the device running this service must be connected to the internet.
